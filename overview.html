				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<!--Write Analysis-->
				<p>The United States is by far outspending the other countries from both an education and a health care perspective. This is consistently true over time. However if we view it as %GDP or per person, this is no longer true for education. However, it remains true for Healthcare
				Therefore, in order to get a full understanding of how much a country is spending on Healthcare and/or education a comparison using population and GDP should be performed. The way that the USA is spending can be perceived differently
				based on the context in which the data is visualized.
				</p>
				<p>For Healthcare the change in amount spent from 2012-2016 is greater for the USA than the other countries. However, if we view this as a percent than Chile is the country that increased their has the greatest increase in healthcare budget.
				For Education the same is true. We can also tell that as a % of GDP the USA is investing more in Healthcare than in Education.
				</p>
				<p>Using the percent change from 2012-2016 as a way to forecast the future. We can predict that in 2020 the USA will still spend the most on both Healthcare and Education. However the runner up will change for both categories. For healthcare the runner up will be Japan and Germany for Education. </p>
