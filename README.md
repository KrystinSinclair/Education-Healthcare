# Health Care and Education Spending World Wide

Author: Krystin Sinclair

# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how nations spend on education and healthcare.
 The total expenditure in these fields will be compared by nation on a per capita basis as well as a % of GDP.

# Analysis
This project is focused on 2012-2016 and the 20 nations that spend the most on healthcare in 2016.
When the spending is compared as a dollar amount over different countries, the United States far outspends the other countries.
The same is true about education spending and military spending.
It is important to realize that the US has a much higher GDP than the other countries that it is being ranked against and therefore more expenditure is inevitable.
If GDP, healthcare spending, education spending and military spending are all compared as single number for a given year. It can be easily seen that GDP is much higher than the spending.
If the three spending categories are compared, it can be seen that healthcare has the most, next is education and military is after that.
When the per person GDP is the metric used to view country comparisons, the USA is no longer the top dog. Switzerland has a higher GDP per person.
Education spending as a percent of GDP also shows that the US is no longer the overly outranked. Sweden is the number one spender.
However, if the healthcare as a percent of GDP is viewed, than the US is the top spender.
If per person is the metric used, than for education the US becomes the middle of the barrel, but for healthcare the US is still the number one spender.
It can also be interesting to see how these numbers change over time. When viewed as a fixed value the US has increased its spending by the most from 2012-2016 in both categories of healthcare and education.
When the growth is viewed as a percent change. It seems that the US has not increased its spending by that much over the time period of 2012-2016.
